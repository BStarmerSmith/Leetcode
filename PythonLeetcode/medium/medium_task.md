# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string `s`, the task is to find the length of the longest substring without any repeating characters.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

Input: `s = "abcabcbb"`

Output: `3`

Explanation: The longest substring without repeating characters is "abc", which has a length of 3.

**Example 2:**

Input: `s = "bbbbb"`

Output: `1`

Explanation: The longest substring without repeating characters is "b", which has a length of 1.

**Example 3:**

Input: `s = "pwwkew"`

Output: `3`

Explanation: The longest substring without repeating characters is "wke", which has a length of 3. Note that "pwke" is not a substring as it contains repeating characters.

## Constraints

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces.
