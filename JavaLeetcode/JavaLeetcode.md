# JavaLeetcode

This repository contains a Java program that removes duplicates from an array in-place and returns the number of unique elements.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine
- Command-line interface (Terminal or Command Prompt)

## Building and Running the Program

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
4. Compile the Java code using the following command:

```
javac -d bin src/*.java src/easy/*.java src/medium/*.java
```

This command compiles all the Java files in the `src` directory and places the compiled `.class` files in the `bin` directory.

5. Once the compilation is successful, navigate to the `bin` directory:

```
cd bin
```

6. Run the Java program using the following command:

```
java JavaLeetcode.src.Main
```


This command runs the `Main` class, which serves as the entry point of the program.

7. The program should start executing, and you will see the output printed in the terminal or command prompt.

Example output:

```
Number of unique elements: 2
Modified array: 1 2
Number of unique elements: 5
Modified array: 0 1 2 3 4
```

8. You have successfully built and run the Java program!
